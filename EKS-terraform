AWS EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed service we can use to run kubernetes on AWS without need of install, operate and to maintain your own kubernetes control Plane/Nodes.
It scales, manages and deploys containerized applications which can run on Amazon public cloud..
Amazon EKS runs across multiple avilability zones(AZ). AWS EKS provide highly avilable and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning and updates.
AWS EKS are composed with:
Control Plane: Composed of 3 master nodes, each running in a single zone or different avilablility zones(for high avilability).
Worker Nodes: Runs on amazon EC2 instance located in a VPC, we can control and configure the VPC allocated for worker nodes.

To deploy an EKS cluster with terraform we need:
> AWS account
> IAM credentilas and access.
> VPC configured for EKS.
